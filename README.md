# Iris_Dataset
The iris flowers have different species and you can distinguish them based on the length of petals and sepals. This is a basic project for machine learning beginners to predict the species of a new iris flower.

The dataset consists of:
1.150 samples
2.3 labels: species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor)
3.4 features: Sepal length,Sepal width,Petal length,Petal Width in cm

Problem Statement:
Create the model that can classify the different species of the Iris flower.

Problem solving:
1.create the dataset.
2.Build the model
3.Train the model
4.Make predictions.
